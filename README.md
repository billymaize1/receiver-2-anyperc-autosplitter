# receiver-2-anyperc-autosplitter
a livesplit autosplitter for Receiver 2 Any%

## functionality
this script will automatically stop, reset, and start the timer when the player restarts via the menu or dies on the first level.
it will split upon reaching the next rank up to the final rank (awake), but will only do the final split when
the player opens the pause menu **AT ANY TIME** during the last level, so try not to open the pause menu until you have all three tapes.  

it keeps track of in-game time, so use the in-game timer on livesplit. the game's timer will automatically ignore loading time.
